# Using ParrelSync to test multiplayer

Info on ParrelSync can be found on the projects [github page](https://github.com/VeriorPies/ParrelSync).

Make sure you install the ParrelSync package for Unity.

Steps to get ParrelSync started are:
- Go into the “ParrelSync” menu at the top of the screen
  - Go to “Clones Manager” and “Open in New Editor”
  - A new copy of the game will appear which is *automagically* synced to the original
- In Unity hub, you will now see a *GameName*_clone_0. It’s the copy that was created by ParrelSync

The reason to use ParrelSync is to not need to build the game or to run it on two separate machines.
:::tip
To use the VR headsets, you still need two individual instances of the game running on seperate machines.
This is because the Oculus program that runs on the computers can only communicate to a single headset
