# Getting Started
Welcome to the Extended Reality Labs, Quadcopter AR Project. This will be the starting point off of which all the documentation will follow.
This guide will outline the basis of how the project works, along with giving you a current (as of Feb 17th 2022) guideline on understanding the flow of the project and the parts.

## Prerequisites
Although we don't expect you to have pre-reqs as a part of this project, an ideal researcher would have:
- An understanding of a programming language; C, C# and Python is what our current stack is built on.
- A basic understanding of the Unity Game engine or any other game engine. (Or how games work)
- An understanding of how Networks work.
