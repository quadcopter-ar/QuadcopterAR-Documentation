# To the transferer
You have been the project knowledge base for the past set years. Congrats on moving on to your next adventure. Before you leave, there are some requirements you need to complete to make it easier for the transferee to continue the project.
1. Make sure you have all the documentation written, updated and setup into git.
2. Make sure you give admin access to the new group and have them remove you as an admin.
3. Add information about how someone can contact you to the `/People/...` directory. Follow structure from previous documents.
4. Make sure the passwords have been given to the new users.
