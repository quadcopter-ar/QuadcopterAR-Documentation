## This Repo contains all the documentation relating to the QuadCopter AR Project

If you are to work on a game, any information that is needed to that game must be stored under
`./Games/<GameName>/...`

If you are a graduating student please also leave any relavent contact information under 
`./People/<Name>.md`. This is to help new people have a way to contact you incase they require understanding of your work.

## Please use markdown as the default file format to handle any documentation. If it is to submit to a group then latex works as well.

A tutorial on Markdown is available [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
